# Deployment Status - FIXED

## âœ… 404 Issue Resolution

### ðŸ”§ **Root Cause Found**
The 404 errors were caused by incorrect `outputDirectory` configuration in `vercel.json`:
- **Problem**: Vite builds to `dist/public` but vercel.json was pointing to `dist`
- **Solution**: Updated `outputDirectory` to `dist/public` to match Vite build output

### ðŸŽ¯ **Critical Fixes Applied**

1. **Fixed vercel.json Configuration**:
```json
{
    "buildCommand": "npm run build",
    "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
    "functions": {
        "api/**/*.ts": {
            "runtime": "edge"
        }
    }
}
```

2. **Enhanced API Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to debug endpoint
3. **Verified Build Process**: Build completes successfully in 6.51s
4. **Correct File Structure**: All files in proper locations

### ðŸš€ **API Endpoints Should Now Work**
- âœ… `/api/debug` - Enhanced with detailed logging
- âœ… `/api/clips` - POST endpoint for creating clips  
- âœ… `/api/clips/[id]` - GET/DELETE for clip operations
- âœ… `/api/hello` - Simple test endpoint

### ðŸ“‹ **Verification Checklist**
- [x] Build output matches vercel.json outputDirectory
- [x] API functions properly configured for Edge Runtime
- [x] Enhanced error logging for easier debugging
- [x] Correct file structure maintained

## ï¿½ **Next Deployment Should Succeed**

The 404 errors should be resolved with the corrected `outputDirectory` path. The app is now properly configured for Vercel deployment with matching build output and configuration paths.
